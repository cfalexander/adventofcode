Personal [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) solutions, as authored by me. In previous years, I've participated in the competition to varying degrees of completion. Regardless, consider the code, as well as the approaches, in this repository fresh.

A while back, [a friend of mine](https://github.com/nicorising/advent-of-code) introduced to me his personal challenge to complete every year's challenges in a different language. I intend to do the same, with a focus on languages commonly seen in research computing.
